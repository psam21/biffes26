Upon reaching the islands of the Malayan Archipelago, Magellan’s mind changes. He becomes obsessed with conquest and conversion, which sparks violent uprisings beyond his control.

Passersby become her audience, and her defiant act quickly draws attention. Seti’s voice spreads, turning her into a symbol for a generation unwilling to accept silence or repression. Produced independently, Soheil Beiraghi’s fourth feature offers a rare, uncompromising look at contemporary Iran. The film stands as an act of resistance, giving space to voices that censorship continues to suppress.",

Against all odds, one of them reaches its destination, upon the desk of the newly appointed local prosecutor, Alexander Kornyev. Kornyev does his utmost to meet the prisoner, a victim of agents of the secret police, the NKVD. A dedicated Bolshevik of integrity, the young prosecutor suspects foul play. His quest for justice will take him all the way to the office of the Attorney General in Moscow. In the age of the great Stalinist purges, this is the plunge of a man into the corridors of a totalitarian regime that does not bear said name.\n                                \n                                                            \n                            \n                            ಸೋವಿಯತ್ ಒಕ್ಕೂಟ, 1937. ಸರ್ಕಾರದ ಸುಳ್ಳು ಆರೋಪಕ್ಕೆ ಬಲಿಯಾಗಿ ಜೈಲು ಸೇರಿದ ಸಾವಿರಾರು ಕೈದಿಗಳ ಪತ್ರಗಳನ್ನು ಜೈಲಿನ ಕೊಠಡಿಯಲ್ಲೇ ಸುಟ್ಟು ಹಾಕಲಾಗುತ್ತಿರುತ್ತದೆ. ಆದರೆ, ಎಲ್ಲ ಅಡೆತಡೆಗಳನ್ನು ಮೀರಿ ಒಂದು ಪತ್ರ ಮಾತ್ರ ಸರಿಯಾದ ವಿಳಾಸ ತಲುಪುತ್ತದೆ. ಅದು ಹೊಸದಾಗಿ ನೇಮಕಗೊಂಡ ಸ್ಥಳೀಯ ಪ್ರಾಸಿಕ್ಯೂಟರ್ ಅಲೆಕ್ಸಾಂಡರ್ ಕಾರ್ನ್ಯೆವ್ ಅವರ ಮೇಜಿನ ಮೇಲೆ ಬಂದು ಬೀಳುತ್ತದೆ. ರಹಸ್ಯ ಪೊಲೀಸ್ ಪಡೆ (NKVD) ಹೂಡಿದ ಸಂಚಿಗೆ ಬಲಿಯಾದ ಆ ಕೈದಿಯನ್ನು ಹೇಗಾದರೂ ಮಾಡಿ ಭೇಟಿಯಾಗಲು ಕಾರ್ನ್ಯೆವ್ ನಿರ್ಧರಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ. ಪ್ರಾಮಾಣಿಕ ಅಧಿಕಾರಿಯಾದ ಇವರಿಗೆ ಈ ಪ್ರಕರಣದಲ್ಲಿ ಯಾವುದೋ ದೊಡ್ಡ ಕುತಂತ್ರ ಅಡಗಿದೆ ಎಂಬ ಅನುಮಾನ ಶುರುವಾಗುತ್ತದೆ. ನ್ಯಾಯಕ್ಕಾಗಿ ಅವರು ನಡೆಸುವ ಹುಡುಕಾಟ ಅವರನ್ನು ಮಾಸ್ಕೋದ ಅಟಾರ್ನಿ ಜನರಲ್ ಕಚೇರಿಯವರೆಗೂ ಕೊಂಡೊಯ್ಯುತ್ತದೆ. ಸ್ಟಾಲಿನ್ ಕಾಲದ ಆ ಕ್ರೂರ ಆಡಳಿತದ ಸಮಯದಲ್ಲಿ, ಒಬ್ಬ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿ ವ್ಯವಸ್ಥೆಯ ವಿರುದ್ಧ ನಡೆಸುವ ಅಪಾಯಕಾರಿ ಹೋರಾಟದ ಕಥೆ ಇದು.",

Around their stillness echoes 1970s New York: a portrait session with Allen Ginsberg, a call with Susan Sontag, fleeting encounters and gestures.

Drawing on archive footage, interviews, and voiceovers, the film unfolds from Jelinek’s own perspective, tracing her radical relationship with language. Rebel, feminist, communist, enfant terrible and uncompromising artist, Jelinek emerges as a figure who weaponised words to confront power, patriarchy, and national mythmaking. The film captures her brilliance and vulnerability, revealing how language itself becomes her primary site of resistance and creation.",
